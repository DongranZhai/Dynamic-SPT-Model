# Dynamic-SPT-Model

##May.20:
### 1: Define the global dominant optical classes, then geographically subdivided in terms of ocean basins. Including plotting of projected optical classes.
### 2.1: Fitting linear regression model on a global scale. Overlap contours of optical classes and Longhurst provinces.
### 2.2: Local time series of each optical class and Longhurst province.
### 2.3: Uncertainty comparison. Evaluating homogeneity of two partition methods.
### 3: Define the global dominant optical classes, then geographically subdivided in terms of ocean basins. Including plotting of projected optical classes.
### 4.1 - 4.4: Fitting static spatiotemporal model (same with model in Hammond et al, 2017) on Longhurst province.
### 5.1 - 5.4: Fitting static spatiotemporal model (same with model in Hammond et al, 2017) on optical classes.
### 6: Uncertainty comparison. Assessing whether trend estimates is more accurate and uncertainties are reduced.
### 7: Input dataset setting for dynamic spatiotemporal models (sptDyn).
### 8.1: The model without optical classes fits dynamic model.
### 8.2: The model with spatial-varying optical classes fits dynamic model.
### 9: Plotting trend estimated from dynamic models.
### 10.1 - 10.2: Uncertainty comparison. Dynamic models.
### 11.1 - 11.3: Diagnose results & visualization
